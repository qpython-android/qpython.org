                  <p><strong>Permissions</strong></p> <p>
                    To enable programming with some of Android’s features, QPython/QPythons requires the following permissions: Bluetooth, GPS, and others, etc.
It doesn't require some permissions like access user account, access phone's status, meaning you cannot use some SL4A APIs. <br />
                    You can disable them from system's setting if you don't need them.


                  </p>
